# Quick Sort using Javascript

Sorting an array of integers with Quick Sort, a divide and conquer strategy algorithm using Javascript.
Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2);

Despite having a worst case time complexity of O(n^2), quick sort algorithm is pretty fast,
and efficient in practical scenarios.
The worst time complexity is most likely avoided by using a randomized Pivot position.
Most of sorting algorithm that is used by language libraries is implementing quick sort.
